 Canción: "Confident"
Artistas: Justin Bieber, Chance th Rapper
Duración: 4:10 min
Álbum: Journals

letra: Don't do it to me
Don't do it to me
Oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me
Oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me
Oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me
Oh no no, oh no no

Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that
I ain't never seen nothing like that, ah-ah
Like a fantasy in front of me, I-I-I
I think that something special is going down
That's right, I think she foreign
I think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
You can tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like an addict
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
Hypnotised by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa master piece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
I could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it (Chance, the Rapper?)

Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains, gotta ask
'Cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to earn the verb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
Stay fitted like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes, it goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll
She say "I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing"
Thots twerk for the goodfella
She money dan' with the money team, ra!

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
You can tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time
I think she might have lied
Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
I'm addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

But still I gotta have it
But still I gotta have it
But still I gotta have it
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no
But still I gotta have it

En la Uru' comiéndono' el pâté
Te vo'a dar duro pa' que no me compare'

Ey, cuidao' con ese mahón
Que se va a romper (ey)
Ese booty lo va a romper (ey)
Yo no sé si yo te vuelvo a ver
Si mañana me vo'a perder
Tú ere' una player
Me hiciste un crossover
Esta ve' metiste
Me diste game over, eh, eh
Porque no puedo olvidar
El perreo aquel
Que se fue viral

Dime si mañana te va' a quedar
Después de la alarma te lo voy a dar
Ey, hoy tú no va' a trabajar, je, no

Si quieres te la saco
Dos trago' y sabes
Que me pongo bellaco
No somo' na'
Pero estamo' envuelto' hace rato

Pa' darte tabla

En una playa por Balí, si no, Cancún
Pide otro Moscow Mule (ey)

I bet you feel it now, baby
Especially since we've only known each other one day
But, I've gotta work shit out, baby
I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now

Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out

Yeah
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim

Pop a couple pills in the daytime
Heard you got a friend, what's her head like?
Probably should've fucked on the first night
Now I gotta wait for the green light
I don't wanna wait for no green light
Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright
Luckily I float at insane heights
Luckily, luckily, luckily, yeah

Location drop, now
Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
Oh, what a cop out
You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out

Yeah
The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim

Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip
Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip, no
I know I said I'd call, I never did, no
(Swim) swim, swim now
I can take you, even though I've never been there
The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again now
I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in, girl

The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim.

Canción: Call Out My Name
Artista: The Weeknd
Álbum: My Dear Melancholy
Duración: 3:59


We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake

I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name)
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (why can't you wait, baby?)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? (call out my name)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my

I said I didn't feel nothing baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time

You're on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
So call out my name when I kiss you
So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? (girl, why can't you wait 'til I)
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way, girl
I'll be on my

On my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way
On my way, on my way, on my way
(On my)

Álbum: Nostalgia
Duración: 3:51


Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side
And tell, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy
'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the pace
All your girlfriends are wasted
They need it, they chase it
Face it, you want it, you crave it
Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it

All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on (woo)
Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (woo)
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done (woo)
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

Just give me some time and space to realize
That you, were busy lying, sleeping 'round with other guys
And what the hell were we?
Tell me we weren't just friends
This doesn't make much sense, no
But I'm not hurt, I'm tense
'Cause I'll be fine without you, babe (woo)

All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on (woo)
Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done (woo)
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (woo)

Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now

Woo

All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on (woo)
Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone

Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done (woo)

Canción: Bellyache
Artista: Billie Eilish
Álbum: Don't Smile at Me
Duración: 3:31


Mind
Mind

Sittin' all alone
Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room for the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny

Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm reckless

I lost my mind
I don't mind
Where's my mind?
Where's my mind?

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)

Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

Artista: Paulo Londra
Álbum: Plan A
Duración: 3:06


Quiero saber qué soy para ti
Porque siempre que no' vemos, se me olvida decir

Que ando muy confundido, tus besos son má' fríos
Y empiezo a creer, que soy uno má' de tus amigos
Ando siempre en la nada, se hace de noche y no llama
Me dice: "mejor mañana", que ya tiene otro' planes

Y yo esperaba ser el primero
Tu plan A, no el tercero
Pero estamo' lejos
De sentir lo mismo, es siempre lo mismo

Esperaba ser el primero
Tu plan A, no el tercero
Pero estamo' lejos
De sentir lo mismo, es siempre lo mismo

Esperaba, por lo menos
Una indicación para ver cómo hacemos (plo, plo, plo)
Si debo de mantenerme cerca o má' lejos
Porque ahora besa' rápido y ante' era lento (oh)

Ya no lo entiendo, 'toy que me pierdo (pierdo, pierdo)
En esas noches cuando fumo y bebo
Parece que soy un zombi, ando medio muerto
Pasa que intento entenderte

Y no te entiendo, ¿cuál es mi puesto?
Si voy primero o voy tercero
No te entiendo, ¿cuál es mi puesto?
Si voy primero o voy tercero

Ando muy confundido, tus besos son má' fríos
Y empiezo a creer, que soy uno má' de tus amigos
Ando siempre en la nada, se hace de noche y no llama
Me dice: "mejor mañana", que ya tiene otros planes

Y yo esperaba ser el primero
Tu plan A, no el tercero (¡no!)
Pero estamo' lejos
De sentir lo mismo, es siempre lo mismo

Esperaba ser el primero
Tu plan A, no el tercero
Pero estamo' lejos
De sentir lo mismo, es siempre lo mismo

Quiero saber qué soy para ti
Porque siempre que no' vemos, se me olvida decir.
