        <p>
            <br>We found each other
            <br>I helped you out of a broken place
            <br>You gave me comfort
            <br>But falling for you was my mistake

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>I put you on top, I put you on top
            <br>I claimed you so proud and openly
            <br>And when times were rough, when times were rough
            <br>I made sure I held you close to me

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>So call out my name (call out my name)
            <br>Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
            <br>I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
            <br>I want you to stay, even though you don't want me
            <br>Girl, why can't you wait? (why can't you wait, baby?)
            <br>Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
            <br>Won't you call out my name? (call out my name)
            <br>Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
            <br>I'll be on my

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>I said I didn't feel nothing baby, but I lied
            <br>I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
            <br>Guess I was just another pit stop
            <br>'Til you made up your mind
            <br>You just wasted my time
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>You're on top, I put you on top
            <br>I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
            <br>And when times were rough, when times were rough
            <br>I made sure I held you close to me

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>So call out my name (call out my name, baby)
            <br>So call out my name when I kiss you
            <br>So gently, I want you to stay (I want you to stay)
            <br>I want you to stay even though you don't want me
            <br>Girl, why can't you wait? (girl, why can't you wait 'til I)
            <br>Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
            <br>Babe, call out my name (say call out my name, baby)
            <br>Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way, girl
            <br>I'll be on my
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>On my way, on my way
            <br>On my way, on my way, ooh
            <br>On my way, on my way, on my way
            <br>On my way, on my way, on my way
            <br>(On my)
