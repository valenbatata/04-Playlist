            <br>Don't do it to me
            <br>Don't do it to me
            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>Don't do it to me
            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>Don't do it to me

            <br>Oh no no, oh no no

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>Focused, I'm focused
            <br>She got a body like that
            <br>I ain't never seen nothing like that, ah-ah
            <br>Like a fantasy in front of me, I-I-I
            <br>I think that something special is going down
            <br>That's right, I think she foreign
            <br>I think she foreign, got passports
            <br>Mi amor started slow, got faster
            <br>She gon' work some more, work some more
            <br>No stopping her now, no stopping her now

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
            <br>Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
            <br>What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
            <br>She's got my attention, she's confident

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>She's confident
            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>And I'm down with it
            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>She's confident
            <br>You can tell by the way she walks in the room

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>She said it's her first time
            <br>I think she might have lied
            <br>Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
            <br>I'm addicted, something like an addict
            <br>Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
            <br>Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
            <br>It's not hard to notice, that I'm open
            <br>Hypnotised by the way she moves

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
            <br>Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa master piece
            <br>What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
            <br>She's got my attention, she's confident

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>She's confident
            <br>Oh no no, oh no no
            <br>And I'm down with it
            <br>Oh no no, oh no no

            <br>I think she might have lied
            <br>Feels so good damn, and I don't know why
            <br>I'm addicted, something like a headache
            <br>Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it (Chance, the Rapper?)

        </p>

        <p>

            <br>Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
            <br>She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains, gotta ask
            <br>'Cause her ass on a learning curve
            <br>And she love to earn the verb, I mean burn the word
            <br>That's only legal with a doctors note
            <br>Real deep pockets like a doctors coat
            <br>Stay fitted like Diddy, hair back tryna rock the boat
            <br>She the first mate wanna rock the boat
            <br>She never forget to ride like a bicycle
            <br>She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
            <br>It goes, it goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll
            <br>She say "I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing"
            Thots twerk for the goodfella<br>
            She money dan' with the money team, ra!<br>
