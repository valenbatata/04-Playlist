            <br>Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side
            <br>And tell, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy
            <br>'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the pace
            <br>All your girlfriends are wasted
            <br>They need it, they chase it
            <br>Face it, you want it, you crave it
            <br>Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it

        <p>
            <br>All of your friends have been here for too long
            <br>They must be waiting for you to move on (woo)
            <br>Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone
            <br>I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (woo)
            <br>Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
            <br>Running in circles, now look what you've done (woo)
            <br>Give you my word as you take it and run
            <br>Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Just give me some time and space to realize
            <br>That you, were busy lying, sleeping 'round with other guys
            <br>And what the hell were we?
            <br>Tell me we weren't just friends
            <br>This doesn't make much sense, no
            <br>But I'm not hurt, I'm tense
            <br>'Cause I'll be fine without you, babe (woo)
        </p>
