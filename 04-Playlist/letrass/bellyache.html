        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Sittin' all alone
            <br>Mouth full of gum
            <br>In the driveway
            <br>My friends aren't far
            <br>In the back of my car
            <br>Lay their bodies
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Where's my mind?
            <br>Where's my mind?
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>They'll be here pretty soon
            <br>Lookin' through my room for the money
            <br>I'm bitin' my nails
            <br>I'm too young to go to jail
            <br>It's kinda funny
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Where's my mind?
            <br>Where's my mind?
            <br>Where's my mind?
            <br>Where's my mind?
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Maybe it's in the gutter
            <br>Where I left my lover
            <br>What an expensive fake
            <br>My V is for Vendetta
            <br>Thought that I'd feel better
            <br>But now I got a bellyache
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Everything I do
            <br>The way I wear my noose
            <br>Like a necklace
            <br>I wanna make 'em scared
            <br>Like I could be anywhere
            <br>Like I'm reckless
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>I lost my mind
            <br>I don't mind
            <br>Where's my mind?
            <br>Where's my mind?

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Maybe it's in the gutter
            <br>Where I left my lover
            <br>What an expensive fake
            <br>My V is for Vendetta
            <br>Thought that I'd feel better
            <br>But now I got a bellyache
            <br>(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
            <br>(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache)
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Maybe it's in the gutter
            <br>Where I left my lover
