            <br>I bet you feel it now, baby
            <br>Especially since we've only known each other one day
            <br>But, I've gotta work shit out, baby
            <br>I'm exercising demons, got 'em runnin' 'round the block now

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Location drop, now
            <br>Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
            <br>Oh, what a cop out
            <br>You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Yeah
            <br>The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
            <br>Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
            <br>So hard to ignore ya, 'specially when I'm smoking, swim
            <br>World is on my shoulders, keep your body open, swim
            <br>I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
            <br>I'm swimming, I'm swimming, I'm swimming, yeah
            <br>Out in California, I'll be forward stroking, swim
            <br>So hard to ignore ya, keep your body open, swim


        </p>

        <p>
            <br> Pop a couple pills in the daytime
            <br> Heard you got a friend, what's her head like?
            <br> Probably should've fucked on the first night
            <br> Now I gotta wait for the green light
            <br> I don't wanna wait for no green light
            <br> Narcolepsy got me feeling stage fright
            <br> Luckily I float at insane heights
            <br> Luckily, luckily, luckily, yeah

        </p>

        <p>
            Location drop, now
            Pedal to the floor like you're runnin' from the cops now
            Oh, what a cop out
            You picked a dance with the devil and you lucked out

        </p>

        <p>
            <br> Yeah
            <br> The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim

        </p>

        <p>
            <br>Swim, push the water to the edge and watch it drip
            <br>Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip, no
            <br>I know I said I'd call, I never did, no
            <br>(Swim) swim, swim now
            <br>I can take you, even though I've never been there
            <br>The tide has currently been thrashing around me again and again now
            <br>I've been drowning for a minute, your body keeps pulling me in, girl

        </p>

        <p>
            <br> The water's getting colder, let me in your ocean, swim
